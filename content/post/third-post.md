What is Stitched Social?

Stiched Social is a modern, AI-driven matchmaking service that automates the workflow of traditional matchmakers (onboarding, sourcing, matching, and iterating) while integrating social elements like group dates, curated experiences, and feedback from members' circles of trust. By combining Al with social matchmaking, we make finding meaningful relationships more effective, community-driven, and personalized than both dating apps and traditional matchmaking â€“ all for < 1/10 the cost of traditional matchmaking.

How Stitched Social Works

1) 20-Minute AI Onboarding Call -- Share your preferences, relationship goals, and what matters most to you. We also talk to the 5 people in your inner circle to help create your 360-degree profile!

2) Curated Match Selection -- We introduce you to 2-3 quality matches monthly from our exclusive community or recruit new people who align with your values and preferences. If your first match isn't a fit, we'll rematch you once for free! 

3) Detailed Match Brief -- For each match, we provide a detailed brief with their background and preferences, compatibility reasoning, and personalized conversation starters.

4) Social Experiences -- Once matched, we curate social experiences to continue connecting with your match and fellow members: double and group dates, themed events and activities, and more.
