On the evening of January 31st, the heart of San Francisco's stylish Nob Hill district was buzzing with excitement as one hundred elite attendees gathered at a chic cocktail bar to celebrate the launch of Stitched, the city’s newest matchmaking service. Swiping is out, and second dates are in! Stitched, founded by Larissa Tyagi and Diana Lim, two software engineers from Apple with alma maters CMU and Penn respectively, aims to revolutionize the San Francisco dating scene.

Tired of the endless cycle of swiping and superficial meetups, Tyagi and Lim created Stitched to foster genuine, in-person connections that go beyond the first date. The soirée featured a vibrant mix of creators, entrepreneurs, models, and more, all handpicked for their ambition and fascinating backgrounds. Guests enjoyed a night filled with classic martinis, soulful music, and the opportunity to make meaningful connections.

Stitched promises a refreshing new take on dating by encouraging quality over quantity and setting the stage for lasting relationships. Join the movement that’s putting second dates back on the map in San Francisco.
